    Restaurants do not often guarantee that goods are free from allergens due to risk of cross-contamination (as they are often prepared in the same space). 
    Therefore, provision and consumption of these goods should be done at the user's risk.
    The user should view and consider the restaurant's allergy statement/policy, should they provide one.

    Therefore, by using this application, you acknowledge that the liability of incidents does not rest on the administrators/developers of this site, but instead any issues should be taken up with the restaurant itself.
